# DiscoverAIBrainProject
Computer Vision model trained to predict brain tumor, aneurysm, and cancer

This was a group project in which we had 2 weeks to compelete a trained model. The dataset was found from kaggle it can be found below. We initially trained the model using googleColab. We decided to use Roboflow enahnce the training which resulted in a higher accuracy rate. The project accurately predicts brain tumors, cancers, and aneurysms. This kind of technology has become increasngly prevelant in the medical space. 

This project was for academic pruposes. We do not aim to profit off of this work. It was completed while taking part in a course known as Discover AI. This course is a 1 credit class offered at Kean University with the goal of teaching students the elementary concpets of Artifical Intelligence and Machince Learning.
